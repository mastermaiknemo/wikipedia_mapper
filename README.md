## Delightfull WikipediaMapper using sinatra gem and vis.js

How to use: Type any Wikipedia article title into the input field and press enter; a graph will be visualized for you.
            You can add as many articles as you want. Equal nodes will be connected together.

Demo available -> [Demo](http://kingski-brothers.com:8080/)

all you need to do: install the missing gems and run `ruby rubapi.rb` in CLI

`gem install sinatra`

`gem install sinatra-reloader (useful for local development)`

`gem install mechanize`

Then visit localhost:4567 and enjoy the enter key (dont keep it pressed too long).
